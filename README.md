# ENSF-592-Project-Part-1

Project Objectives (Phase I)
1.To gain experience with the design and development of a relatively larger software project
2.To gain practical experience in OOP design and development, interacting with a data baseand GUI implementation.
3.To gain the experience of real-world data analysis.4.To use engineering tools (python packages)  to design and analysing engineering problems

Phase I (GUI and DataBase)
The  purpose  of  the  first  phase  of  the  project  is  to  get  familiar  with  the  python Graphic User Interface (GUI) and use a database for keeping required data.In the first phase, you will write a GUI application that manages traffic information from  Calgary  city.  The  required  data  is  available  on  Calgary  city  website (https://data.calgary.ca/browse?sortBy=newest).

GUI
The python GUI that you are developing must have the following functionalities: 
    ●It should be able to read and write the traffic information from/to database and keep it in the right data structure
    ●It should be able to display the traffic records information on the computer screen. 
    ●The user should be able to select type of information and corresponding year for doing analysis.●You should be able to load the calgary city map and you should be able to show the maximum traffic volume or accident based on the year on the map.

Packages
Here is the suggestion of some packages you can use for the project:
    ●Database: Mongodb
    ●GUI: tkinter
    ●Drawing map: folium

You are free to use any other types of packages and modules for database, gui, and drawing map.

Marking
    ●Read and write to the database: 5 Marks
    ●Sort the data and find the max value: 5 Marks
    ●Analyzing data and drawing chart: 5 Marks
    ●Map drawing and writing the map.html: 5 Marks
    ●Project Demo: 5 Marks
    ●Total Mark: 25 Marks
    ●Due date: 23 July-2020
